# NinjaTrader 8™ NinjaScript Auto-Generated Scaffolding & Documentation

This repository contains **auto-generated scaffolding code and documentation** for the NinjaTrader 8™ (NT8) trading platform’s NinjaScript framework.  

All content is produced **via .NET reflection**—no original platform code is included.

A custom tool used to build contents of this repository is available at [ninjatrader-autodocs-tools](https://github.com/matdev83/ninjatrader-autodocs-tools).

## Purpose

This project is intended to enhance code awareness for LLM agents and code tools when working on NinjaTrader client code (e.g., custom indicators, strategies).  
It is designed to be used in conjunction with tools such as:

- [gitmcp.io](https://gitmcp.io/)
- [context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7)

These tools can ingest the scaffolding and documentation to provide better code completions, analysis, and AI-driven coding support.

## What’s Included

- [**Scaffolding code**](https://github.com/matdev83/ninjatrader-autodocs/tree/HEAD/generated-code) for NinjaScript framework (classes, methods, etc.), auto-generated via .NET reflection.
- **Documentation** auto-generated from public API structures.
- No original or proprietary NinjaTrader source code.

## Usage

Navigate to [https://gitmcp.io/matdev83/ninjatrader-autodocs](https://gitmcp.io/matdev83/ninjatrader-autodocs) to get instructions on how to set up your local coding platform using MCP, so agents can be made aware of the details of the NinjaScript™ framework.
